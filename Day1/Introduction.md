# SystemVerilog
- It is a combined Hardware Design and Hardware Verification language.
- Has Inherited features from Verilog, VHDL, C/C++ (Superset of Verilog)

## FEATURES
- Object Oriented Programming support
- New Data types
- Assertions
- Constrained Randomisation
- Coverage support
- Easy C model integration (can import C fucntions)

## USER VIEWS
System Verilog has 5 major parts
1. SVD – System Verilog for Design:-Features supporting
Design
2. SVTB – System Verilog for Test benches:- Test bench specific
Features
3. SVA – System Verilog Assertions:- Features for temporal and
concurrent assertions
4. SVDPI – SV Direct Programming Interface:- For better
C/C++ Integration
5. SVAPI – SV Application Programming Interface:-For better
Coverage/Assertion integration
